 *     store the location of the data buffer created and filled by

 * Returns:
 *   int -- The number of VDIF frames contained in the buffer, zero if
 *     end no frames could be read, and -1 on error.
 * Notes:
 *   This method attempts to read a contiguous set of VDIF frames that
 *     is the equivalent of one SG block per SG file contained in the SG
 *     plan. Blocks from different files are stitched together such that
 *     the first frame in one block directly follows the last frame of
 *     another block. Blocks with data that do not flow contiguously 
 *     from the first frame for the current block are stored in the 
 *     buffer of the associated SGPart, inside SGPlan. Upon subsequent 
 *     calls to this method no further blocks of data is read from that 
 *     particular SG file until its block can be stitched togther with 
 *     the contiguous flow. However, data continuity is NOT checked 
 *     between consecutive calls to this method.
 *   Block counter for each SGPart is updated if frames where read from
 *     that file.
 *   Memory is always allocated to *vdif_buf based on the estimated 
 *     number of frames expected to be read from file(s). It is left to
 *     the user to free *vdif_buf irrespective of whether data was 
 *     received or not.
