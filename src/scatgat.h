 * Notes:

 *     from the first frame for the current block are stored in the

 *     calls to this method no further blocks of data is read from that 
 *     particular SG file until its block can be stitched togther with 
 *     the contiguous flow.
 *   Block counter for each SGPart is updated if frames where read from
